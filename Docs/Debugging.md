# Pixel debug selection

Pixel diagnostics are local to the calling thread, including calls outside TBB.
Use `SelectDebugPixel(x, y, targetX, targetY)` or
`SelectDebugRegion(x, y, minX, minY, maxX, maxY)` (inclusive bounds), then inspect
`IsPixelDebugEnabled()` at the diagnostic site. `SetPixelDebugEnabled(bool)`
enables or clears the current thread explicitly. There is no fixed worker-count
limit and callers do not need a TBB thread index.

Legacy `GYT_DEBUG_PIXEL*` macros forward to these functions for existing snippets;
their thread-index argument is evaluated but no longer indexes shared storage.
Selection remains active on that thread until another selection or explicit reset.
The utility does not change SPPM accumulation or introduce exceptions.
