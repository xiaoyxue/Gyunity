# Gyunity
## Description
This is a physically based renderer (CPU based ray tracing), and it's original name is SmallSPPM since I have answered someone's question about sppm to write a demo. But now I decide to extend it to a graphics library, so I rename this project to "Gyunity" [dʒiːjuːnəti].

Next plan is to implement the GPU based renderer and add more features like MCMC(MMLT), VCM, Differentiable Rendering core, Path Guiding methods...

## Features
- PathTracing (PT)
- Stochastic progressive photon mapping (SPPM)
- LightTracing (LT)
- Bidirectional PathTracing (BDPT)
- Volume PathTracing (VPT)
- Equi-angular sampling
- Multiple importance sampling (MIS)
- Microfacet model with GGX distribution (GGX)
- Ambient Occlusion (AO)
- Low Discrepancy Sequence (Halton, Sobol...)
- KdTree, BVH
- Fast vector and matrix calculation (SIMD-SSE)
- Simple Memory Pool

## Build
Ensure CMake is on `PATH`. Visual Studio 2026 requires CMake 4.2 or newer.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/xiaoyxue/Gyunity.git`
2. From the repository directory, run `.\init.ps1` in Developer PowerShell for VS, or `init.cmd` in Developer Command Prompt for VS. This recreates `external\build` and builds the dependencies in Debug and Release.
3. Open `Gyunity.sln` and build the solution.

## Projects
| Project | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Gyunity` | The renderer itself, built as a static library: integrators, BSDFs and materials, lights, shapes, accelerators, samplers and math. |
| `GyunityApp` | The application that sets up a scene, renders it and writes the image (`x64\<Config>\GyunityApp.exe`). Scenes are defined in `GyunityApp\CornellBox.h`, and `main.cpp` chooses the scene, camera and integrator. Run it from the `GyunityApp` folder so the `..\resources` paths resolve. |
| `GyunityTest` | Unit tests (googletest). |

## Scene builder
`GyunityApp\SceneBuilder.h` provides material factories and ordered helpers for
triangles, quads, spheres, meshes, area lights and environment lights. It does not
initialize the scene or select its accelerator. Existing `CornellBox.h` scenes
remain unchanged while they are migrated in separate steps.

`GyunityApp\CornellBoxScenes.h` adds parallel, builder-based versions:

| Original class in `CornellBox.h` | New function |
|---|---|
| `CornellBoxMesh` | `CornellBoxScenes::GlassBunny` |
| `CornellBoxMeshWithSlope` | `CornellBoxScenes::Slope` |
| `CornellBoxSphere` | `CornellBoxScenes::SphereBox` |
| `EnvironmentMapScene` | `CornellBoxScenes::Environment` |

Each new function accepts a `SceneBuilder&`. For example:

```cpp
SceneBuilder builder(scene);
CornellBoxScenes::GlassBunny(builder);
```

The original code and `main.cpp` scene selection are retained unchanged for
side-by-side comparison; the application has not switched to the new versions.
Use the same camera, accelerator and integrator when comparing a scene pair.
`GyunityTest` compares primitive order, sampled geometry, materials and lights
between all four pairs. Run it from `GyunityApp` to resolve the scene assets:

```powershell
Set-Location GyunityApp
..\x64\Debug\GyunityTest.exe
..\x64\Release\GyunityTest.exe
```

`AddCornellBox(builder)` adds the standard walls and ceiling light, matching
`CornellBoxMeshEmpty`. `CornellBoxOptions` can omit the back wall or light and
change the light's half-size and power multiplier (defaults: `0.25f` and `85`).
For scenes whose objects precede the light, keep that insertion order:

```cpp
SceneBuilder builder(scene);
AddCornellBoxWalls(builder);
builder.AddMesh("meshs\\bunny3.obj", builder.Glass(Vec3(1), Vec3(1)),
    Transform::Translate(Vec3(0, -0.5, 0)) * Transform::Scale(0.28, 0.28, 0.28));
AddCornellBoxLight(builder, 85);
```

Resource paths are relative to `resources`; run from `GyunityApp` as before.
Quads use triangles `(a, b, c)` and `(a, c, d)` with an explicit normal.
Use `AddTriangle` for a different vertex order: even cyclic permutations can
change floating-point results. Emitting quads register two area lights sharing
the same shapes as their corresponding primitives.
